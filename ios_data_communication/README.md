# iOS Data Communication Prototype

## Project Overview
This project is a prototype implementation of an **iOS Data Communication Layer** integrated with a **Flutter** application. The solution simulates data reception via a mocked USB communication layer using Apple's **External Accessory Framework (EAF)** and integrates seamlessly with Flutter using **Platform Channels**.

## Architecture
The project follows **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **Clean Architecture** principles to ensure scalability and maintainability.

### Key Architecture Components
- **Native iOS Module:** Written in Swift, responsible for simulating data reception via a timer or random data generator.
- **Flutter Layer:** Manages the user interface and invokes native methods through **Platform Channels**.
- **Use Cases:** Each API call is separated into dedicated **UseCase** classes to improve code organization and simplify future enhancements.
- **State Management:** Utilizes **Riverpod** for efficient state control and dependency injection.

## Features
- Simulates data reception via **Timer** or **Random Data Generator**.
- Implements **Platform Channels** for seamless communication between Flutter and iOS.
- Includes structured error handling for improved reliability.
- Clean code structure adhering to **DDD** and **Clean Architecture** best practices.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Flutter SDK** (v3.0 or later)
- **Xcode** (latest version recommended)
- **Swift** (v5 or later)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirHosseinRashidi/iOS-Data-Communication-Prototype-Challenge-Submission.git
cd ios_data_communication
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Set Up the iOS Native Module
1. Open the `ios` folder in **Xcode**.
2. Create a new Swift file and define the **DataCommunicationModule**.
3. Implement data simulation logic using a **Timer** or **Random Data Generator**.
4. Register the platform channel in `AppDelegate.swift` as follows:

### Step 4: Run the Project
1. Use the following command to run the Flutter app:
```bash
flutter run
```
2. Confirm that the data simulation logs appear in the Flutter console.

## Error Handling
- The app gracefully handles the following scenarios:
  - **Connection Timeout:** Logs detailed error messages and retries the connection.
  - **Data Corruption:** Implements basic validation checks for data consistency.
  - **Module Integration Failure:** Provides detailed logs for debugging platform channel issues.

## Improvement Opportunities
- Implement comprehensive **unit tests** for both Flutter and iOS layers.
- Refactor error handling by adopting the **Observer Pattern** for improved error tracking and reporting.
- Enhance data simulation by introducing more dynamic patterns such as **data streaming** or **event-based triggers**.

## Version Control & Documentation
- The project uses **Git** for version control.
- Clear and descriptive commit messages are maintained throughout the repository.
